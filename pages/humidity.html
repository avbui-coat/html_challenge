        With our current analysis, it is difficult to find any obvious correlation between latittude and humidity. There is a clear band of many data points at 100% humidity, and there do seem to be strong clusters of high humidity around the equator and in some other areas (e.g. a strong band of 0% humidity at latitude > 60). Further analysis is required.
